Overpass is a free, Open Source typeface designed by Delve Fonts. The design of Overpass is an interpretation of the well-known “Highway Gothic” letterforms from the Standard Alphabets for Traffic Control Devices published by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Starting from those specifications, critical adjustments were made to the letterforms to create an optimal presentation at smaller sizes on-screen and later for display sizes, especially in the lighter weights.

Overpass can be used for everything from extended passages of text in print and online, to UI design, posters, wayfinding signage, and environmental graphic design.

    Designers: Delve Withrington, Dave Bailey, and Thomas Jockin
    TrueType Hinting: Jason Campbell
    Direction: Dave Crossland, Andy Fitzsimon, Jakub Steiner, and Ben Dubrovsky
    Special thanks: Aaron Bell for his diligence in preparing v4.0 for release and Michael Luton for his insight and support.
